EDA --> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to
maximize insight into a data set;
1.uncover underlying structure;
2.extract important variables;
3.detect outliers and anomalies;
4.test underlying assumptions;
5.develop parsimonious models; and
6.determine optimal factor settings.
